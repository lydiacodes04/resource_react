          Hi! My name is Lydia Lockhart, and I am a social services professional
          who has learned to code! My love of learning human languages led me to
          be interested in computer languages. As I explored coding, I was
          intrigued by how communicating with computers, I could design
          interactive websites. I decided to apply my software development
          skills to design an app youth could use to find resources near them.
