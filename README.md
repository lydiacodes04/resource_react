# What To Wear (WTWR) Fullstack App

The What to Wear (WTWR) App is a web-based application which makes suggestions to the user about what to wear based on the current weather conditions where they are located. Users can sign up and create an account. Once they log in, they can add images of clothing items to their profile. The user enters what kind of weather the clothing is for along with the clothing's name and image in the clothing card. The app uses an external weather API programmed to the user's location to filter the clothing items based on their specified weather suitability. Users can log out and edit their profiles.


This app is a fullstack application, utilizing React for the frontend, working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It utilizes a custom-made backend, which uses Express.
