This app utilizes React for the frontend, working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It utilizes a custom-made backend, https://github.com/lydiacodes04/se_project_express which uses Express.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
